# What we are about doing next?

## 1 - How to use git and github?

## 2 - How to integrate git and github with RStudio?

## 3 - How to organize our repository and make it open and available?

# What you are be able to do at the end?

## 1 - start your repository

## 2 - organize your files 

## 3 - extend your knowledge to other reproducibility techniques
